# Filmstripper
A tool for fusing multiple images together into a single filmstrip.

## Usage

Filmstripper takes a folder as input and a file-path as output. It can generate both vertical and horizontal filmstrips, the choice is made by either writing `v` for vertical, or `h` for horizontal. Vertical is the default, if nothing else is chosen.

```
python3 filmstripper.py /input/directory/ /output/file.png [v/h]
```
